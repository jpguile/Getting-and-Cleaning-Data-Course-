activityType

The activity labels consist of WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

The subjects who carried out the experiment are represented as a number from 1 to 30.


# Transformations

Training and test data set rows were appended and then a unified data set created from the source files.

Measurements were extracted for mean, standard deviation for each measurement.

variable/column names were labeled with descriptive cleaner names.

Results were output as an indepenent tidy data set at ./data/TidyDataSet.txt
